October 2025 - Upgrade for Delphi 13



This was a significant migration with a full revert to the base SynEdit code.

There have been some minor changes to support virtual which as at writing have not been tested.

All other core pas SynEdit changes have not yet been migrated



This new editor loses lots of old functionality but also gains a lot of possible functionality

D12 and D13 versions are not compatible and have IFDEFs to protect differences
